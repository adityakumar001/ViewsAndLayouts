# ViewsAndLayouts
Project to demonstrate various views and layouts available to us in Android.

View class represents the basic building block for user interface components. A View occupies a rectangular area on the screen and is responsible for drawing and event handling. View is the base class for widgets, which are used to create interactive UI components (buttons, text fields, etc.).

A ViewGroup is a special view that can contain other views (called children.) The view group is the base class for layouts and views containers.

This project demonstrates how to use layouts to lay views on the device's screen and how nested layouts help create really complex views.
We should also keep in mind to keep the view hierarchy  shallow i.e nesting of layouts minimum as nested layouts take a longer time to draw.
